# GenFlow-AI-Powered-Document-Intelligence

Currently This project leverages Generative AI to replicate a person's words and feelings based on their WhatsApp data. By uploading the WhatsApp chat data, the chatbot can respond to queries as if it were the person themselves. This project utilizes a Language Learning Model (LLM) and Flask to generate API requests.

  - `query_service.py`: Handles query processing and response generation.
- **`config.py`**: Contains configuration settings.
- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `data/` directory and add the necessary environment variables.

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python app/services/main.py
   ```

2. **Upload WhatsApp chat data:**
   Use the provided API endpoint to upload the chat data.

3. **Interact with the chatbot:**
   Send queries to the chatbot and receive responses that mimic the person's words and feelings based on the chat data.

## API Endpoints

### Query the Chatbot

- **Endpoint:** `/api/ask`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Send a query to the chatbot and receive a response.

### Example Request

**Query the Chatbot:**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "Your query here"}' http://localhost:5000/api/query
```

## Future Scope

1. Addition of Advanced RAG features
2. LLM-RAG Scoring Techniques
3. More methods to retrieve information from internet and using it in Software Engineering Lifecycle.
